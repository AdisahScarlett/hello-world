# hello-world
A short, refreshing repository that welcomes me to the Git Hub world.


Hi friends of GitHub. My name is Adisah and I hope to get my own cat some day. 
I'm really fond of Bootstrap and Javascript because of how simple yet powerful they are.
What I've learned from my studies in College is that taking a website from start to finish is one of my favorite challenges.
I also really love tracking statistics and watching how projects progress over time.
